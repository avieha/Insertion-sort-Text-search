# Insertion-sort & Text-search
the file mainsort.c contains an implementation of insertion sort in C, using pointer arithmetics *only*(accessing as char arry is forbidden).

the maintxt.c gets a word and a text and can do one one of three options: 1. print all the lines in the text containing the word
2. print all the familiar words in the text, even if there is a lack/mistake in up to 1 letter.
